## 🔍 Detailed Competitor Breakdown

Here is an honest look at the other tools in the market.

### 1. OpusClip
The market leader. OpusClip offers high-quality captions and good AI curation, but the pricing is prohibitive for beginners.
*   **Pros:** excellent caption templates, face tracking is accurate.
*   **Cons:** Very expensive ($29 for 20 clips), strict credit limits, slow processing times during peak hours.

### 2. Vizard AI
Vizard is more of a video editor than a pure "clipper." It allows for significant manual layout changes.
*   **Pros:** Great drag-and-drop editor, good for changing layouts manually.
*   **Cons:** The AI selection isn't as sharp as Opus or Reelify; often picks irrelevant moments.

### 3. GetMunch (Munch)
Munch focuses heavily on "Virality Scores" and trend matching.
*   **Pros:** Connects with keyword trends.
*   **Cons:** No real free tier. You must pay to get usable clips. $49/mo is steep for individual creators.

### 4. 2Short.ai
A simple, web-based tool for quick YouTube links.
*   **Pros:** Fast, simple interface.
*   **Cons:** Very limited subtitle styles, heavily watermarked on the free plan, cannot upload raw files (must be YouTube link).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why is Reelify free while Opus costs $30?**
A: Most older tools use expensive API calls (Legacy Models) for every second of video. Newer tools like Reelify use optimized "Sparse Indexing" AI models that cost 90% less to run, allowing for generous free tiers during their growth phase.

**Q: Which tool is best for Agencies?**
A: If you are managing multiple clients, **Reelify** is the best choice due to the volume (90 hours). OpusClip and Munch will become too expensive at scale.
